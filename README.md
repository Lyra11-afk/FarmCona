# FarmCona
FarmCona is a scratch-based app that teaches students and young farmers on efficient farming techniques, thereby increasing productivity and ending hunger in Nigeria. It was developed for the STEM Festival 2025 by a group of 3 called Team Oasis from Silicon Delta Innovation Hub, under the junior coding category.
